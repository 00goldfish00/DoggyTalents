Someone is impersonating me (ProPercivalalb), someone has created this account under my name and is uploading my mod with out my permission. I was going to add my mod to curse but it seems someone has got here first. Im not sure how I can prove I am the owner of Doggy Talents. This is the original github https://github.com/ProPercivalalb/DoggyTalents it has been updated over this last 4 years or something. I have recently uploaded a file containing this message to show that I own the github account and hopefully prove that I am ProPercivalalb. Please could you suspend this post and account and make it so that I can create an account named propercivalalb.
